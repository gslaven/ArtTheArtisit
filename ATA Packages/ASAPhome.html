        <h3>ASAP-after-school arts program “I am a Super-Hero Too!”</h3>
        <div class="stuff">    
            <p class="text">
                I am beginning a new Art Enrichment program in the CSRA for after school arts. This program consists of teaching young artists
                how to draw and create their own comic books as well. This is a 12-week arts program that teaches the basic skills
                to drawing characters and backgrounds as well as storytelling 101. At the same time each child will learn about
                themselves and how to build their own self-confidence, and not to bully others in a positive atmosphere. The
                next 12-week program completes the school year as the children start learning the fundamental tools of the computer
                art graphics programs to help create numerous comic books for themselves. They will also start to learn the business
                side of the art industry. This is well rounded program that no parent would want to pass up.

        <h3>My Anti-Bullying Challenge</h3>
        <p>
            Children need to be able to express themselves through good communication with others. Our children can learn to help each
            other, especially when their peers are going through problems. They should be able to share their ideas, thoughts,
            and values without feeling ashamed. This also means NOT to bully others, and to not be bullied by others either.
            Children should be able to stand up for their friends and themselves against bullying, and let the surrounding
            adults know when this is going on in the schools or where ever. We may never stop all bullying or children from
            hurting one another, but I know we can do something. My hope is that with my help and with other parents’ help,
            we can help grow our children to be creative and express themselves to others in a caring way. Please consider
            enrolling your child into this arts program.

        <h3>My Own Heart for the ARTS</h3>
        <div class="stuff">
        <p class="text">
            My desire is for every child to enjoy drawing and being creative on their own (and be just like me). I want them to see themselves
            in a positive light. I know how kids can be sometimes. I also had my struggles growing up and I could face the
            challenges in my own way. One of my challenges was being partially colorblind, called green-red colorblindness.
            I did the best I could growing up and always asked someone close for help. So, even when children go through
            struggles, they can image these struggles as villains and handle them in an appropriate way.

    <section class="oddsection">
        <h3>Why is the arts important?</h3>
        <p>
            Art and visual design plays an important part today. Artists, designers, architects, and engineers all play a role on how
            we view the world. Computers and mobile devices became more accessible when visual designers created icons, apps,
            symbols, and images to help associate words with pictures. Art helps stimulate the brain. Art is therapeutic
            when it comes to relaxing and needing a form of release. There are many other reasons the arts can help children
            and adults, and you can probably google them yourself. The arts can also help build some important leadership
            skills. (loyalty, discipline, respect, selflessness, honesty, integrity, and fortitude)
